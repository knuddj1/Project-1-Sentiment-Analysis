    "For my third year project I have continued working with David Rozado on a Sentiment Analysis Engine.\n",

    "Last semester, as part of a special topic study, I began learning about, and creating models for, Sentiment Analysis. The intentions of this project were to create a model that would correctly predict the sentiment of a given piece of text 80% of time. David offered for me to continue working on the problem this semester. Due to to the fact I didn't achieve the result above and the availability of recent advancements in the field of NLP, I accepted.\n",
